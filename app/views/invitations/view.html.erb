		<br><br><h2>June 23 Update</h2>

		<p><b>1. Ceremony time and itinerary change</b></p>

		<p>The ceremony will now be held at 3:00 pm. This will allow everyone to have a break and cool down before the reception begins. Cocktail hour will now be held on the Vineyard Patio at 6:00 pm and dinner at 7:30 pm, when the sun is lower and it begins to cool down. </p>

		<p>We've updated the itinerary on the invitation accordingly.</p>

		<p><b>2. Attire</b></p>

		<p>After visiting Spirit Ridge, we've discovered that the Lavender Rooftop (ceremony location) has a deck-like wooden floor with small spaces between boards. As such, we don't recommend wearing shoes that have a thin heel, as you might get stuck and hurt yourself. </p>

		<p>Also, we'd like to emphasize that it's going to be roasting hot, so please dress appropriately. Dress shorts and shirt are fine, provided that they are not Hawaiian-themed and look classy :)</p>

		<p><b>3. Gift Registry</b></p>

		<p>Some of you have asked if we've set up a gift registry. We haven't done so, as we are fortunate enough to have all of the staple household items we need already and have limited room to bring things back to Vancouver with us. Your presence at our wedding is present enough, but if we are honored with a gift from you, one that is physically small would be really appreciated. Contributions towards our honeymoon would really help, or gift cards for the Bay would be great. But of course, you're welcome to give anything you'd like!</p>

		<p><b>4. Don't forget to book your accommodation</b></p>

		<p>If you haven't done so already, don't forget to book your room! From now on, rooms are only available on a space-available basis and will book up fast. Also, the last day to get the discounted group rate is August 1.</p>

		<p>If you'd like to find someone to share a room or ride with, <a href="mailto:hello@brielleandmike.com">send us an email</a> and we'll help coordinate with others.</p>

		<p>We look forward to seeing you all at our wedding!</p>

		<h2>About Spirit Ridge Vineyard Resort &amp; Spa</h2>

		<p><a href="http://www.spiritridge.ca" target="_blank">Spirit Ridge</a> is a beautiful resort located in Osoyoos, BC. Surrounded by the rolling vineyards of the South Okanagan wine country and overlooking Osoyoos Lake. Spirit Ridge offers a great wedding atmosphere. The resort is adjacent to the popular Nk'Mip Cellars Winery and features an on-site spa, golf course, pool, and a variety of restaurants.</p>

		<p>We chose Spirit Ridge because we wanted to have an all-outdoor, summer wedding in the Okanagan. What better place than Osoyoos, home of the warmest lake in Canada! The resort also features luxurious condo-style accommodations, making it the perfect summer getaway spot for our guests.</p>

		<ul class="information">
			<li>The discounted room rates require a minimum two night stay. [We will be staying at Spririt Ridge from Friday, August 16th until Sunday, August 18th, but you're welcome to stay longer. Osoyoos is a great vacation spot.]</li>

			<li>One-bedroom units are based on 1-2 adults; two-bedroom units are based on 1-4 adults. Additional people are $25/night. [Again, we recommend that you try and bunk up with another family in a two-bedroom unit to save costs!]</li>
